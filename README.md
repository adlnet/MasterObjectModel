# Master Object Model
The Master Object Model (MOM) is an xAPI profile that denotes how a student's learning can be tracked throught their entire "lifetime" within the Total Learning Achitecture (TLA).

This profile is broken up into two parts: an [API Profile in pure JSON](./MOM_Profile.json) which is intended for developers, and a human-readable [Specification](./MOM_Spec.md)
